# deleted-message-obfuscator
based on an awful nightmare i had one night where snapchat decided that instead of actually deleting messages, it would just obfuscate them by rephrasing them horribly and then warping the text like a captcha image.

todos:

- [x] get initial captcha with awkward phrasing up

- [ ] make captcha legible

- [ ] make a messaging app ???

- [ ] give option to delete messages

- [ ] make every deletion as horrible as the nightmare i had
