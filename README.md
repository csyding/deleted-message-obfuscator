# deleted-message-obfuscator
based on an awful nightmare i had one night where snapchat decided that instead of actually deleting messages, it would just obfuscate them by rephrasing them horribly and then warping the text like a captcha image.

todos:
[x] get initial captcha with awkward phrasing up
[] make captcha legible
[] make a messaging app ???
[] give option to delete messages
[] make every deletion as horrible as the nightmare i had
